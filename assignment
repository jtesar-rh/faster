Create role that configures servera as an NFS server, providing 3 shares

documents      
video          
audio

Users of the role can configure the common path for the exports.
for instance if the user sets the path to /shares, then the exported directories will be

/shares/documents
/shares/video
/shares/audio

The user can also configure a single host that the share will be exported to, together with the export mode - rw for read/write and ro for read only. 
That means that the share can be only mounted on host specified.


Hints: 
1) To export a directory over NFS, there must be the nfs-server service running (nfs-utils package)
2) NFS port has to be opened in the firewall (there is nfs service defined in firewalld
3) To export a directory an entry in /etc/exports needs to be created. The format is following:

/exports/docs    host.example.com(rw)

This means that directory /exports/docs is possible to mount on host.example.com read/write
